# Traffic Crashes Analysis

## Project Overview
The "Traffic-Crashes-Analysis" project is dedicated to the analysis and prediction of traffic crash data in Chicago. Our objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the geolocations of traffic accidents. This is achieved by analyzing patterns and correlating various data points from crash reports. Our model aims to enhance public safety by identifying high-risk areas and contributing to preventive measures.

## Data Source
The traffic crash data utilized in this project is publicly available and can be accessed from the City of Chicago's official data portal. The dataset provides detailed information on each traffic incident, allowing for a thorough analysis.

## Technologies and Tools
This project is fundamentally built on some programming languages and technologies to effectively process and analyze the data:

- **Languages:** Python, PySpark
- **Technologies:** Databricks Platform, Apache Spark

## Getting Started
Download the Python notebook file "Traffic Crash Analysis" onto your local computer. Using any of your preferred cloud computing platforms, import the notebook. We have used the Databricks community edition for our project. The Databricks platform is recommended to display interactive visualizations generated in this project.
